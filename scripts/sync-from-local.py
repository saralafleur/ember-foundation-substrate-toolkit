"""Import the live standalone install (~/.claude/skills + ~/.claude/agents)
into this repo's plugins/, applying the distribution transforms:

  - experimental banner on every SKILL.md
  - personalized wording sanitized (Sara -> the user)
  - existing plugin path-note blocks preserved in agent files
  - engineering-manager home paths rewritten plugin-relative
  - bash portability enforced in shipped shell templates
  - memory/ never synced (plugins ship empty memory)

Direction is one-way: ~/.claude is the working set; this repo is the
packaged distribution. Run before /refresh-plugins, review `git diff`,
then publish. Exits non-zero if a personal reference survives.

Usage: python3 scripts/sync-from-local.py [--dry-run]
